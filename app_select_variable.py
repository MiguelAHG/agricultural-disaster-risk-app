- Hazard

First, you have to select "Barangay" or "Other variable".

- Other variable: Select a variable in the hierarchy.
    
In the hierarchy, the option that you choose at a higher level will change the options available at a lower level. Because of this, it is good to answer the selectboxes from **top to bottom**.

For example, if the element “Crops” is selected, 6 hazard options are available. However, if the element “Fisheries” is selected, only 4 hazard options are available. This is what we mean when we say that changing a higher level changes the options at a lower level."""
